# My personal website
---

I have built a simple all-purpose web-site using [hugo-PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX) as the template. The site uses Hugo for the backend which is extremely faster than a simple jekyll site (which was what I was using up until now).

I did minor modifications to the main theme, as my likings. It took me couple tries to handle the hosting...
