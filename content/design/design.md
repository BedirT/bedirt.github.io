Just got my HUION 22 Pro a couple weeks ago, had to jump in and
make something interesting. Didn't think much :) Just pen on the tablet!

Didn't spend much time texturing or adding fine details. Just
a quick sculpting and some basic lighting. Still took me around an
hour and half to get it done.

Enjoy!
