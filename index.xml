<h2 id="what-is-continuous">What is continuous?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first describe the main task we will be handling; continuity. Continuous problems are tasks that has no specific terminal state, therefor will go on forever. As simple as it sounds, it is not a piece of cake to tackle the issues it brings with itself. Some examples could be the stock-market, where there is no end and you keep getting data. Or as book suggests access-control queuing task (Example 10.2).</p>
<p>I will follow a simple format so that we all can stay on the same page and everything is clear cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is discounting not applicable for continuing tasks?</li>
<li>The Remedy: Average Reward
<ul>
<li>Logic behind it</li>
<li>Why is it true: Math</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Differential Semi-Gradient SARSA</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-discounting-not-applicable-for-continuing-tasks">Why is discounting not applicable for continuing tasks?</h2>
<p>First of all, we should know that discounting works well for tabular cases. The issue we will be talking about rises when we start to use approximations.</p>
<p>We have a sequence of episodes that has no beginning or end, and no way to clearly distinguish them. As the book suggests, we have the feature vectors to maybe have a use of, but then the issue of <strong>clearly seperable</strong> arises. We might have two feature vectors that has no to little difference between them, which won&rsquo;t be possible to be able to distinguish.</p>
<p>Since we have no start point or end point, and since there is no clear line in between episodes, using discounting is not possible. Well it actually is possible. But it is not needed. Actually using $\gamma = 0$ will give the same results as any other one. That&rsquo;s because the discounted rewards are proportional to average reward. That&rsquo;s why instead we will only use average reward. Here I will put the proof that both will results in the same order (discounted and without discounting):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/average_reward/images/discounting_proof.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>The main issue with discounting in the approximation cases is that, since we have states depending on the same features, we do not have the <strong>policy improvement theorem</strong> anymore. Which was stating that we can get the optimal policy, just by changing all the action selections to the optimal ones for each state. Since we could choose the probabilities for one state without effecting the others it was pretty easy to handle. Now that we lost that property there is no guaranteed improvement over policy.</p>
<p>As Rich puts it <em>&ldquo;This is an area with multiple open theoretical questions&rdquo;</em>. If you are interested.</p>
<h2 id="the-remedy-average-reward">The Remedy: Average Reward</h2>
<p>Average reward is a pretty popular technique used in dynamic programming. Later on included into the Reinforcement Learning setting. We use average reward for approximated continual setting as we discussed above. Without discounting means that we care about each reward equally without thinking of if it occurs in far future etc.</p>
<p>We denote it as $r(\pi)$. Not much detail but for the intuition part I will give the main definition for it:
$$
r(\pi) \doteq \sum_{s}\mu_\pi\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{r, s&rsquo;}p(r, s&rsquo;|s, a) r
$$
Basically we consider the best policy as the policy which has the most $r(\pi)$. For average reward we define returns as the difference between the $r(\pi)$ and the reward received at that point, this is called the differential return:
$$
G_t = R_{t+1} - r(\pi) + R_{t+2} - r(\pi) + \ldots
$$
I believe differential return holds almost all the properties normal returns had. Only change we will do is to replace the reward with the difference i.e. $R_{t+1} - r(\pi)$. This goes for TD errors, bellman equations etc.</p>
<h3 id="quick-math">Quick Math</h3>
<p>So we already saw the formula for $r(\pi)$ but we didn&rsquo;t actually see how it came to existence or what all those things mean.
$$
r(\pi) \doteq \lim_{h\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{h} \sum_{t=1}^{h}\mathbb{E}[R_t|S_0, A_{0:t-1} \sim \pi]
$$
Let&rsquo;s explain what&rsquo;s happening here. We are assuming we have $h$ number of rewards, we are summing expected value of all the rewards given the first state and the action trajectory following the policy $\pi$, and we are dividing it to $h$ to get to the average of these rewards. So we simply had $h$ many rewards and we got the average. Then;
$$
= \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} \mathbb{E}[R_t|S_0, A_{0:t-1} \sim \pi]
$$
Since I have the expectation inside the summation, we can actually simplify the summation with the division. We do have to put $t\rightarrow\infty$ to ccorrect the formula, as we will have number of samples approaching infinity. Next jump on the book seems fuzzy, but when you open it up it is extremely easy to see how it happens.</p>
<p>So if we have a randomness over something, what we want to do is to get the expectation of it. If we get the expectation that means we can formulate it, therefor no more randomness. In an MDP we have three kind of randomness possibly can happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>States are random</li>
<li>Actions are random</li>
<li>Dynamics are random</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean? It means we can be in a state, and we don&rsquo;t know what state that might be, and from there we will take an action, but we don&rsquo;t know for sure which action will that be. And the last one is that we take that action but since we don&rsquo;t know the dynamics of the environment (if stochastic even if we do know) we don&rsquo;t know which state we will end up in. So actually this formula goes like;
$$
\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E} [ \mathbb{E}[R_t|S_t, A_t]]]
$$
Where the inner most is for the states and in the middle its the actions, the last one is the dynamics. So we know from bellman equations how to write this down;
$$
\mathbb{E}[R_t] = \sum_{s&rsquo;,r}p(s&rsquo;,r|s, a) r
$$
This is the expected reward is it not ? Now lets add the action selection on top:
$$
\mathbb{E}[R_t|A_t] = \sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s&rsquo;,r}p(s&rsquo;,r|s, a) r
$$
One last thing left is the state selection. We are using $\mu_\pi(s)$ to specify state distribution given the state (which the book covered earlier - Chapter 9). So the last piece of the puzzle;
$$
\mathbb{E}[R_t|A_t, S_t] = \sum_{s}\mu_\pi(s)\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s&rsquo;,r}p(s&rsquo;,r|s, a) r
$$
That&rsquo;s all, we therefor have the average reward formula covered.</p>
<p>In practice we will be using moving mean to calculate average reward.</p>
<h2 id="differential-semi-gradient-sarsa">Differential Semi-Gradient SARSA</h2>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t really have much to add. If you read the <a href="https://bedirt.github.io/reinforcement%20learning/control%20methods/2020/03/10/Semi-Gradient-Control.html">Semi-Gradient SARSA</a> post, this is mostly just changing the update rule for the continuous setting. That will be the change for $G_{t:t+n}$.</p>
<p>$$G_{t:t+n}=R_{t+1}-\bar{R}_{t+1}$$</p>
<p>$$+R_{t+2}-\bar{R}_{t+2}$$</p>
<p>$$+\ldots+ R_{t+n}-\bar{R}_{t+n}$$</p>
<p>$$+\hat{q}(S_{t+n},A_{t+n},w_{t+n-1})$$</p>
<p>The TD error then will be like:</p>
<p>$$
\delta_t = G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w)
$$</p>
<p>and we will use another step size parameter $\beta$ to update the average reward value. Here is the pseudocode:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/average_reward/images/sarsa_differential_pseudo.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>And here is my implementation of it, which does not require much explanation I assume:</p>

</div><p>It is basically almost the same with the previous version. We are first checking if we have more elements than $n$ which means we need to remove the first elements from the storage. Then we have a check which sees if we have enough elements, because we won&rsquo;t be making any updates if there is not at least $n$ elements in the trajectory. The rest is the same update as in the pseudocode.</p>
<p>Again we run an experiment using the same settings as before which results in a high varience learning, thought it does learn which is the point here right now 😄.</p>

      <title>Semi-Gradient Control Methods</title>

      <description>Prime numbers are really important, how do we find them though?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semi-Gradient Prediction</li>
<li>Intro to Linear Methods</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read the prediction part for the semi gradient methods, it is pretty easy to extend what we know to the control case. We know that control is almost all the time just adding policy improvement over the prediction case. That&rsquo;s exactly the case for us here for semi-gradient control methods as well.</p>
<p>We already have describe and understood a formula back in prediction part (if you read it somewhere else that&rsquo;s also fine), and now we want to extend our window a little.</p>
<p>For prediction we were using $S_t \mapsto U_t$ examples, now since we have action-values instead of state-values (because we will pick the best action possible), we will use examples of form $S_t, A_t \mapsto U_t$ meaning that instead of $v_\pi(S_t)$ we will be using estimations for $q_\pi(S_t, A_t)$.</p>
<p>So our general update rule would be (following from the formula for prediction);</p>
<p>$$
w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha [U_t - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_t)] \nabla\hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_t)
$$</p>
<p>As we always do, you can replace $U_t$ with any approximation method you want, so it could have been a Monte Carlo method (Though I believe this does not count as semi-gradient, because it will be a direct stochastic gradient since it does not use any bootstrapping, but the book says otherwise so I am just passing the information 😄). Therefor we can implement an $n$-step episodic SARSA with an infinite option, which will correspond to Monte-Carlo (We will learn a better method to do this in future posts).</p>
<p>The last piece of information to add is the policy improvement part, since we are doing control, we need to update our policy and make it better as we go of course. Which won&rsquo;t be hard cause we will just be using a soft approximation method, I will use the classic $\epsilon$-greedy policy.</p>
<p>One more thing to note, which I think is pretty important, for continuous action spaces, or large discrete action spaces methods for the control part is still not clear. Meaning we don&rsquo;t know what is the best way to approach yet. That is if you think of a large choices of actions, there is no good way to apply a soft approximation technique for the action selection as you can imagine.</p>
<p>For the implementation, as usual we will just go linear, as it is the best way to grasp every piece of information. But first I will as usual give the pseudo-code given in the book.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/semi_gradient_control/images/sg_sarsa.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I only took the pseudocode from chapter 10.2 because we don&rsquo;t really the one before, as it is only the one step version. We are interested in the general version therefor n-step.</p>

</div><p><strong>Initialize</strong> We start by initializing the necessary things; we need step size $\alpha$ also $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. Other then these we need to initialize our weight vector. We will have a weight vector that is for each action concatenated after one another. So if we assume that we have 4 observations lets say [1 0 1 0], meaning weights 0 and 2 are active, and if want to update the weights for action 0, we will have [<strong>1 0 1 0</strong> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] if we had 3 possible actions in total.

We take the observations as input, this will come from the environment, and assuming we get an array of the probabilities for each action given the observations from <code> _act(obs)</code>. Then all we have to do is to roll the die and decide if we will choose a random action or we will choose the action that has the most value for the current time, and thats exactly what we do here ($\epsilon$-greedy action selection).</p>

</div><p>There is a bit of a change here, from the pseudocode I provided. Since we want a full seperation between the agent-environment-experiment we need a class system for the algorithms therefor we won&rsquo;t be following what is on the pseudocode.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> what happens here is actually not that different, since we only need $n+1$ elements to make the update happen we won&rsquo;t keep the rest of the trajectory. Whenever we use n numbered trajectory the first element becomes useless for the next update. Therefor we remove the first element from the trajectory and use the rest to make our update.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal</strong> we also have a terminal state, and as can be seen in the pseudocode there are some differences that should be changed for the updates when we reach the terminal state. Logical enough, we do not have n+1 element left to complete the calculation we were doing therefor we will just use the rewards rather than $\hat{q}(s,a,w)$ . Therefor we need another function to handle this, which we call <code>end()</code> in our structure;</p>

</div><p>Surprise.. Yeah since we are using linear functions, $\nabla w^Tx(s, a) = x(s,a)$. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how would be the experiment part and run the code to get some results then.</p>

</div><p>I used tile coding and the grid world environment in our library. If you want you can modify a little to use another state representation or Rich Sutton&rsquo;s tile coding library, or for environment gym.</p>
<p>Anyways, what we do is pretty simple if you read through, and you can ask for clarification on any point if looks weird.</p>
<p>Main point here are the agent functions and how we use them, all three are used as we said, on each step we have the <code>agent.step()</code>, for each step we have the <code>update()</code> called except the terminal state. Which we will call <code>end()</code> instead.</p>
<p>I will give only one graph as result as usual, here is 100 runs on the stochastic grid world environment.</p>

      <title>Counting Sort</title>

      <description>One of the most efficient sorting algorithms</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Counting sort is a nice in-place sorting algorithm that we can use for sorting instantly. (This is mostly used for competitive programming.) What I meant by this is, we can use counting sort when we are getting the input. This will not get any additional cost for us, and really good technique for using in-place sorting. I&rsquo;ll get there after explaining the algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="complexity-">Complexity ?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Let me tell you the complexity if you are wondering, but I will explain &ldquo;why&rdquo; after the algorithm itself. <strong>O(n+k)</strong> : n , is size of the array that we will sort and k is the maximum element we have.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<hr>
<p>OK. Let&rsquo;s think of an array. For the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s make it short&hellip;</p>
<pre><code>      myArray = [2, 3, 7, 4, 3, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>We have an array -unsorted- , minimum number is <strong>2</strong>, maximum is <strong>9</strong> and we have <strong>6</strong> elements in the array. Alright so let&rsquo;s think of one more array. Which is from 0 (array starting point) to our maximum number (9) and all the values are initially <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>      INDEXES    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
weAreCounting = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong> We are going to iterate over first array one by one, and we will increment the values that we have (i.e. for first step it is myArray[0] which is 2 so go to weAreCounting array and increment [2] by 1):</p>
<pre><code>for i in myArray:
    weAreCounting[i] += 1

<p>NOW WHAT WE HAVE AT THE END OF THIS LOOP?</p>
<pre><code>      INDEXES    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
weAreCounting = [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>So weAreCounting array basically shows us how many of these numbers we do have (i.e. we have 2 threes so weAreCounting[3] = 2).</p>
<p>This part is how you have all the items counted. Now we can use this as sorted array (with iterating over it) or we can have our new array that will have the sorted array directly. For the second version:</p>
<p>My logic will be to use same array before (myArray) so that it will be more efficient (space-wise).</p>
<p>So I iterate thorough weAreCounting and if the number is bigger than 0 I will add it into myArray. That is all of the logic.</p>

</div><p>If you check the complexity in the code, you will see that we have two loops, one is doing n operation (going through the array that we will sort). Second loop is doing k operation (which is the maximum number that we have in the array that we will sort). So time complexity will be O(n+k).</p>
<p>The space complexity: we have two arrays (we could have 3 but we decrease it to 3 because we used the one at the beginig two times. Since at the end we will not going to need that one.) one is size of n and one is size of k so our complexity will be O(n+k).</p>
<p>Now I suggest you to go to the link below, and try to solve the questions in Week 3/ Counting Sort section. So that you will have full understanding about this question. If you like the concept of it you can star or watch out repository as well. Have a great one!</p>

      <description>Prime numbers are really important, how do we find them though?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Before starting-</strong> What is Prime Factorization ? What is a Prime number ? If you are curious about these please checkout this link before proceed because I will not explain them here :)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">Wikipedia - Prime Numbers</a></p>
<p>Since we all know what a prime number and composite number is, let&rsquo;s look at our realllly simple algorithm. Actually there is nothing fancy here, we are just using simple Sieve of Eratoshenes(Hardest name to pronounce, I checked online if I am right) algorithm. By the way that topic also pre-requised for this post, but fortunetely we already have a tutorial-explanation for it. If you don&rsquo;t know or confused about it in some ways please check the links below:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation/tree/master/Week01">Some sources to learn about Sieve of Eretosthenes</a></p>
<p>Since &ldquo;WE&rdquo; covered everything required, let me involve in this learning process too&hellip; Prime factorization: This is highly important topic. All your passwords , your bank accounts and stuff are protected by these numbers. Anyway that is why we actually have couple algorithms about Prime Factorization. There is a good answer on <a href="quora.com">quora.com</a> about the prime number algorithms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different algorithms get used based on how large the number is. It goes something like this:</p>
<p>Small Numbers : Use simple sieve algorithms to create list of primes and do plain factorization. Works blazingly fast for small numbers.</p>
<p>Big Numbers : Use Pollard&rsquo;s rho algorithm, Shanks&rsquo; square forms factorization (Thanks to Dana Jacobsen for the pointer)</p>
<p>Less Than  10^25  : Use Lenstra elliptic curve factorization</p>
<p>Less Than  10^100  : Use Quadratic sieve</p>
<p>More Than  10^100  : Use General number field sieve</p>
<p>Currently, in the very large integer factorization arena, GNFS is the leader. It was the winner of the RSA factoring challenge of the 232 digit number</p>
<p><em>Arun Iyer</em> <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-fastest-prime-factorization-algorithm-to-date">quora.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK cool, we have a lot of options, although you can see that these numbers are gigantic. $10^{25}$ ?? This was the smallest one mentioned above by the way. So we don&rsquo;t really care about them, they are exist because like I said before, these numbers are extremely powerful so people need biiig ones. Since our languages supports (for C++) until $10^{19}$ , and our tutorials are for ACM-ICPC kind programming contests, considering that these contests have time limit and %100 sure that if $10^{25}$ will given&hellip; you probably should search for some trick in question, because we cannot compete that many operations on time.</p>
<h2 id="finally-the-algorithm">Finally the Algorithm</h2>
<p>Anyway after all explanation lets talk about our &ldquo;small&rdquo; algorithm. It really is nothing much than using Sieve algorithm. We are just going to optimize it a little bit. Let&rsquo;s say we already runned our sieve function:</p>

</div><p>We have a vector named primes and it has all the primes from begining(2) to size.</p>
<p>$$primes -&gt; [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 19 , 21 , &hellip; ]$$</p>
<p>What will we do is we will use basic logic and check every prime number and if it can divide our number <strong>N</strong>. If it can divide , we will just put it into our new vector (If you don&rsquo;t know vector you still can use list or array, depends on the language). If we can divide we will divide it, with this way we will decrement our operations. So let&rsquo;s say we have <strong>18</strong> as our <strong>N</strong>. We start with first element in the <strong><em>primes</em></strong> which is <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is <strong>2</strong> dividing <strong>N = 18</strong> ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes obviously so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put <strong>2</strong> into our <strong>Factors</strong> vector;</li>
</ul>
<p>So -&gt;</p>
<p>$$Factors -&gt; [ 2 ]$$</p>
<p>And we will divide our N by 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N = 18/2 = 9</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to check if 2 is dividing N which is not becuese <strong>N = 9</strong>. So lets pass 2 and go to 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is <strong>3</strong> dividing <strong>N = 9</strong> ? Yes</li>
<li>Put <strong>3</strong> into our <strong>Factors</strong> vector;</li>
</ul>
<p>$$Factors -&gt; [ 2 , 3 ]$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N = 9/3 = 3</strong></li>
<li>Is <strong>3</strong> dividing <strong>N = 3</strong> ? Yes</li>
<li>Put <strong>3</strong> into our <strong>Factors</strong> vector;</li>
</ul>
<p>$$Factors -&gt; [ 2 , 3 , 3 ]$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N = 3/3 = 1</strong></li>
<li>Is <strong>3</strong> dividing <strong>N = 1</strong> ? Nope</li>
<li>Proceed to <strong>5</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5</strong> ? Yes we will stop here. This is the next optimization, at most we will go until $p^2 \leq N$ (and p is my prime number that I am checking). This is what determines my complexity in this method. So I have $\sqrt{N}$ here. This is also my number that will go into O notation -&gt; O($\sqrt{N}$). (Mathematically this complexity is represented with $O(\pi(\sqrt{N})) = O(\sqrt{N}\times lnN)$)You can further check the code C++ implementation. I commented it so you can see what is going on in each step. After understanding the code I highly recommend you to solve questions about this topic, we have our list for this question as well, check the link at the bottom.</p>

      <description>How to find sum of maximum of the subarrays</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What we will learn today is, how to find the , in optimal solution. First, let&rsquo;s clarify the goal a bit.</p>
<p>What is subarray? Subarray is an array that is included in the bigger array. So if we have an array that has 7 elements in it. What we have is elements that have indexes of: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 . A subarray is smaller array inside of this big array. So for example 1, 2, 3  or 4, 5 are subarrays. But 1, 3 is not a subarray because the subarray should be contiguous. So our task is to find the largest contiguous array in our big array.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/kadane/images/not_subarray.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Since we clarify our objective let&rsquo;s look at the solutions we have. First let&rsquo;s see what will be the brute force solution since that will be the first one which comes to mind. What we would do is, we would start from 0 index and hold it, check every elements before that index and keep the largest one. So if we have [3, 5, 7, 9] in the array. We would first check the 3. We would see that it is the largest subarray since there is none other than that. And than we would check the index 1 -&gt; 5, we have 5 and 5 + 3 = 8. The bigger one is 8 so we keep 8. Than we go for 2nd index -&gt; 7. We have 7, 7+5, 7+5+3 so that biggest one will be 7+5+3 which is 15, we keep it. Then next one : index 3 -&gt; 9. We have 9, 9+7, 9+7+5, 9+7+5+3. Largest one will be 9+7+5+3 = 24. So we compare the ones we found as sum of subarrays and the greatest one will be 24, the last one we checked, that&rsquo;s because we have no negative elements in the array. Anyways that would be the brute force solution and still a smart one. But the time complexity would be O(n^2). Since we take the index and check every others that we can combine with this index. Let me visualize this one:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/kadane/images/bruteForce.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>OK, we got this part. So we got the question, now what is the optimal solution for this problem. What is this guy , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Born_Kadane">Kadane</a> , found. Here is the algorithm then. This algorithm is dynamic, which means we will approach the result using the ones we find before. OK, this guy teaches us a way that has complexity O(n), linear time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with an example so it will be more clear. Our array is [5, -2, -4, 4, 4]. Kadane says that in each iteration we have only two options to get the max subarray:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be only itself</li>
<li>It can be itself combined with the maximum subarray that previous index has.</li>
</ol>
<p>Man, this is a smart solution. OK, what he says is let&rsquo;s say we calculated the sum of maximum subarrays until index 1 which has value -2. For the sake of understanding let&rsquo;s calculate with brute force. We have -2 and -2+5. The greater one is -2+5 = 3. So let&rsquo;s proceed. This time let&rsquo;s use Kadane&rsquo;s Algorithm for calculating the 3rd step. What are the options:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be only itself (We have -4 as the 2nd indexed value so = <strong>-4</strong>)</li>
<li>It can be itself combined with the maximum subarray that previous index has. (We have 3 as 1st index&rsquo;s max Subarray sum, so = <strong>3-4</strong> = <strong>-1</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>So we have a -1 and -4 &hellip; -1 indeed. But is it always the second option then? Let&rsquo;s see with another part of our array. Let&rsquo;s proceed one more step. Don&rsquo;t forget that we have -1 as our current max. 3rd index -&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be only itself (We have 4 as the value = <strong>4</strong>)</li>
<li>It can be itself combined with the maximum subarray that previous index has. (We have -1 as the previous index&rsquo;s maximum -&gt; <strong>-1+4=3</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we approached the first option, 4 &gt; 3 so we will keep 4 instead of 3. And repeat this until the end &hellip; Really that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/kadane/images/kadaneTable.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Now that we understand the logic. Let&rsquo;s proceed to the code. I will give pseudocode here.</p>
<pre><code>kadane(Array){

    generalMaximum = currentMaximum = Array[0]

    for (i = 1 until n) {
        currentMaximum = maximum of(Array[i], currentMaximum + Array[i]);
        if(currentMaximum &gt;= generalMaximum) generalMaximum = currentMaximum;
    }

    return generalMaximum;

}

      <description>An introduction to Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reaaally introductory post for Machine Learning basics. What is Supervised and Unsupervised learning?</p>
<h2 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is the most common machine learning problem. In Supervised Learning we already know what the correct output should be like.</p>
<p>There are two categories for supervised learning, first one is <strong>&ldquo;regression problem&rdquo;</strong> and the second one is <strong>&ldquo;classification problem&rdquo;</strong>. I will explain both with examples.</p>
<h2 id="regression-problems">Regression Problems</h2>
<p>In regression we have an output that is continous and we are trying to predict what will be the correct answer/output/label for our input. Lets see an example to understand the concept better.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a friend who has a chocalate company. He has a lot of money and he wants to make his product sell as many as Snickers. OK. But his chocalates are not famous as Snickers. Now , what he should do is, take a look at the competitor. There is a chart which has two dimensions. One is the price. Another is the popularity. Now that since we have continous output for the prices. We will predict the one that we are looking for. (I will just give the popularities according to myself.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs1.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Now, looking at this output. What should we do is, putting a straight or polinomial line to the outputs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs2.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs3.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Then we will have our line that will help us to predict the price. According to the surveys, our chocalates have 8 point for the popularity. So what will be the best price according to the survey and the industry&hellip;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs4.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>It seems something like 70¢ &hellip;</p>
<p>This is the regression problem &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="classification-problems">Classification Problems</h2>
<p>In classification, the simplest one, binary classification, we have two options, either true or false. We also can say that we will predict the result in a binary map. Let&rsquo;s check an example.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples:</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give an absurd example so that it will be more permament. So we have a friend who just ate 5 kilos of Nutella and he is 24 years old. We want to predict if he will get sick or not. And we have a dataset that have people&rsquo;s ages that ate 5 kilos of Nutella and got the sick or not !!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs5.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>So according to this graph our friend will get sick or not. It is a binary example. There is just two probabalities. This is a classification problem. Let&rsquo;s see the expected result &hellip;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs6.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>(He will probably get sick, according to our prediction.)</p>
<h2 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p>The <strong>unsupervised learning</strong> is the second most common machine learning problem. In unsupervised learning we don&rsquo;t know the result for each input. We will obtain a structure form the data. We do not know what are the exact effects of our inputs. We will use <strong>clustering</strong> for this.</p>
<h2 id="clustering-problem">Clustering Problem</h2>
<p>We basically will seperate the data according to variables.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/blog_posts/ml_basics/images/graphs7.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you got hundred different composition classes&rsquo; final essays. They all have different topics. What clustering do is, classifying all the essays according to their topics. So that if we use clustering, all these classes&rsquo; articles will be separated. This is just one variable (topic). If you want, you can add more variables to make the groups more specific. In this case we can add words count for example.</p>]]></content:encoded>
