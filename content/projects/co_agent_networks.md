## Introduction

Co-Agent Networks is an actor-critic framework that utilizes some set of interactive nodes. We took this idea under investigation and developed multiple supervised and unsupervised settings that utilizes the nodes as actor-critic agents. The idea of Co-Agent systems is introduced by Philips S. Thomas, and is still being investigated.

## Features

We have developed a fully working framework that utilizes the nodes as actor-critic agents. We have completed multiple experiments and reported the results for the future researchers.
